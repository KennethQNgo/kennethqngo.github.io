Hello! I’m Kenneth Ngo, a Spring '23 graduate from Cal State Fullerton with a B.S. degree in Biochemistry. In my free time, I try to explore and research about computational chemistry and its applications in drug discovery. My academic background has sparked a fascination with how we can use computational tools to innovate in healthcare and improve patient outcomes.

I’ve always been captivated by the intricacies of molecular interactions and the potential of computational methods to unlock new understandings in this field. As I consider furthering my education with a PhD in Computational Chemistry, I’m eager to apply my skills and curiosity to challenging problems in the industry.

When away from my computer, I’m an avid tennis player and enjoy working out at the gym.
